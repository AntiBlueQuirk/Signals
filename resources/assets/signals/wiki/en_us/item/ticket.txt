A Ticket can store a list of destinations. Destinations can be configured in the following ways:

1. By right-clicking the ticket, a GUI opens up in which the destinations can be entered.
2. By right-clicking a Station Marker, the Station Marker's name will be appended as destination to the Ticket.
3. By shift-right-clicking a Minecart with the Ticket, the destinations from the Minecart will be copied to the Ticket.
4. By shift-right-clicking the Ticket in the air, the Ticket's destinations will be cleared.

By right-clicking a Minecart with the Ticket, the Minecart will be configured with the destinations stored on the Ticket. The ticket is not consumed in the process.
